# QDK-Python

## Introduction

QDK-Python is the repository for Python packages of the Quantum Development Kit (QDK). Currently, this consists of the following packages:

- `qdk` [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/qdk.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/qdk)
- `azure-quantum` [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/azure-quantum.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/azure-quantum)

Coming soon:

- qsharp

## Installation and getting started

To install the packages, we recommend installing the Anaconda Python distribution. For instructions on installing Conda on your system, please follow the [Conda user guide](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).

To install the QDK package, run

```bash
pip install qdk
```

To install the Azure Quantum package, run

```bash
pip install azure-quantum
```

To get started running examples, start a Jupyter notebook:

```bash
cd examples
jupyter notebook
```

## Development

Install pre-reqs:

```bash
pip install azure_devtools pytest pytest-azurepipelines pytest-cov
```

To create a new Conda environment, run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

in the root directory of the given package (`qdk` or `azure-quantum`).

Then to activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate <env name>
```

where `<env name>` is the environment name (`qdk` or `azurequantum`).

To install the package in development mode, run:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Note on Packages

While we encourage contributions in any part of the code, there are some exceptions to take into account.
- The package `azure.quantum._client` is autogenerated using the [Azure Quantum Swagger spec](https://github.com/Azure/azure-rest-api-specs/tree/master/specification/quantum/data-plane). No manual changes to this code are accepted (because they will be lost next time we regenerate the client).
- The package `qdk.chemistry._xyz2mol` is maintained [here](https://github.com/jensengroup/xyz2mol) and included as a vendor package in this repo. Please make any suggestions or improvements to the code there.
