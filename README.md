# Azure Quantum SDK

## Introduction

This repository contains the azure-quantum Python SDK.

Use azure-quantum SDK to submit quantum jobs written in Q#, Qiskit, or Cirq to the Azure Quantum service:

## Installation and getting started

To install the Azure Quantum package, run:

```bash
pip install azure-quantum
```

If using qiskit, cirq or qsharp, include the optional dependency as part of the install command:

```bash
pip install azure-quantum[qiskit]
pip install azure-quantum[cirq]
pip install azure-quantum[qsharp]
```

To get started and submit your first job, see the official [Azure Quantum documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/quickstart-microsoft-qiskit-portal?pivots=platform-ionq).
