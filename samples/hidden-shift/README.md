# Finding hidden shift of bent functions using the Azure Quantum service

This sample demonstrates how to use Qiskit and Azure Quantum together to learn the hidden shift of bent functions.

This sample is available as part of the Azure Quantum notebook samples gallery in the Azure Portal. For an example of how to run these notebooks in Azure, see [this getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/get-started-jupyter-notebook?tabs=tabid-ionq).
