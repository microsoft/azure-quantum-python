# A practical introduction into quantum signal processing (QSP)

This is an Azure Quantum sample illustrates how to evaluate polynomials using Qiskit, a single qubit, and quantum signal processing.

This sample is available as part of the Azure Quantum notebook samples gallery in the Azure Portal. For an example of how to run these notebooks in Azure, see [this getting started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/quantum/get-started-jupyter-notebook?tabs=tabid-ionq).
